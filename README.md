Visual Hook Reference for WordPress
===================================

A proof of concept plugin for WordPress, to display a label next to each of a collection of pre-defined hooks, as and when they are executed.

Contains a basic API for adding support for specific hooks, via third-party plugins.

This is a proof of concept that handles the basic hook name display task. Each context could require additional, unique features. Please fork and experiment as you see fit. :)
